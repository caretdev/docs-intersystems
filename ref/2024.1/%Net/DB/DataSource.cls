/// This class implements the IRIS Native API for Object Script DataSource interface. At this time that interface consists
/// solely of the <method>CreateConnection</method> method.
/// <h2>IRIS Native API for ObjectScript</h2>
/// <p>
/// The Native API for ObjectScript follows the API used on other language platforms. It starts with a static API that
/// allows the user to connect to an IRIS Namespace, either local or remote, using an Iris Connection. The connection interface allows
/// the user to then instantiate the IRIS Native API class (<class>%Net.DB.Iris</class>). That instance can then be used to access IRIS Global Arrays, manage transactions,
/// invoke functions and methods implemented in routines or classes, and instantiate remote iterators.
/// </p>
