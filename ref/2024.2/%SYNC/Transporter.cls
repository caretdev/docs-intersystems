/// <h1>SYNC Transporter</h1>
/// <h2>Overview</h2>
/// <p>
/// 	%SYNC.Transporter is a utility class used to export and import objects from one namespace to
/// 	another. Raw object data is copied to a transport container global. The transport container global
/// 		is then exported to a file and moved to the desired location where it can be imported
/// 	into another namespace. The import namespace must contain runnable classes
/// 	corresponding to type of each object contained in the transport container.
/// 	IDs and references can be abstracted during transport and resolved on import to the correct ID value as it exists in the
/// 	import namespace.
/// 	</p>
/// <h2>Create a Transport Container</h2>
/// 	<p>
/// 		To transport objects using the Transporter, simply instantiate the Transporter and add the desired objects.
/// 		When all objects are in the transport container, export it to a file. The following method that transports instances
/// 		of Sample.Person to a transport container is implemented as:
/// <example>
/// classmethod TransportByState(pState as %String(MAXLEN=2) = "MA", pDirectory as %String = "") as %Status {
/// 	try {
/// 		set statement = ##class(%SQL.Statement).%New()
/// 		set statement.%ObjectSelectMode = 1
/// 		do statement.prepare("select %ID as ID from Sample.Person where home_state = ?")
/// 		set persons = statement.%Execute(pState)
/// 		set transporter = ##class(%SYNC.Transporter).%New()
/// 		while persons.%Next() { set tSC = transporter.AddObject(persons.ID.%Oid()) write !,$Select($$$ISOK(tSC):"Successfully added ",1:"Error occurred adding "),persons.ID.%Id()," ",persons.ID.Name," to the transporter" }
/// 		do transporter.ExportFile(pDirectory _ "people"_pState_".gof")
/// 		set tSC = $$$OK
/// 	}
/// 	catch tException {
/// 		set tSC = tException.AsStatus()
/// 	}
/// 	quit tSC
/// }
/// </example>
/// <br>
/// 	Running this method produces the following output:
/// <pre>
/// 		SAMPLES>d ##class(Sample.Person).TransportByState("NY","/Users/test/Downloads/")
///
/// 		Successfully added 12 Nathanson,Debra I. to the transporter
/// 		Successfully added 19 North,Molly K. to the transporter
/// 		Successfully added 71 Grabscheid,Lawrence A. to the transporter
/// 		Successfully added 108 Massias,Mary I. to the transporter
/// 		Successfully added 179 Eastman,Lawrence M. to the transporter
/// 		Successfully added 188 Ihringer,Dmitry G. to the transporter
/// 		Successfully added 195 Isaacs,Dmitry A. to the transporter
/// 		Exporting to GO/GOF format started on 12/12/2011 08:31:33
/// 		Exporting global: ^OBJ.EXP.37
/// 		Export finished successfully.
/// 	</pre>
/// <br>
/// 		The file, peopleNY, created by running the example above now contains the object data for each of the objects selected
/// 		by the dynamic SQL statement. The file also contains abstracted keys for each of the objects referenced
/// 		by the objects explicitly added to the transport container. It is the user's responsiblity to explicitly
/// 		add referenced objects if more than the key is required. For example, if the Company object referenced by
/// 		an Employee object needs to transported then it must be added explicitly by calling AddObject and passing it
/// 		the OID of the Company object.
/// </p>
/// <p>
/// 	The transport file can be moved to a place where it is visible to the namespace where it is to be imported. To import
/// 	a transport file, simply instantiate the %SYNC.Transporter class and call the Import method. The following example simply imports
/// the transport file back into the same namespace where it was produced. The rows transported are deleted first to demonstrate
/// the Import behavior.
